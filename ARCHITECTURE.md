# K9 Technical Architecture Documentation

## Overview

K9 is a distributed cognitive operating system kernel built on Plan 9 principles, designed to enable emergent cognitive pattern recognition and neural-symbolic integration across heterogeneous computing environments.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Cognitive-First Design
K9 prioritizes cognitive workloads through:
- **Attention-based scheduling**: Processes are scheduled based on cognitive importance
- **Pattern-aware memory management**: Memory allocation considers data pattern locality
- **Emergent behavior support**: System design enables unexpected cognitive patterns

### 2. Distributed Coherence
Following Plan 9's distributed philosophy:
- **Everything is a file**: All resources exposed through filesystem interface
- **Network transparency**: Remote resources appear local
- **Namespace unification**: Global namespace across distributed nodes

### 3. Multi-Architecture Abstraction
Clean separation between portable and architecture-specific code:
- **Portable kernel** (`port/`): Architecture-independent functionality
- **Architecture layers**: Hardware-specific implementations
- **Unified interfaces**: Common APIs across all platforms
