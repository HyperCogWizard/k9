## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Plan 9 development environment or cross-compilation tools
- Architecture-specific toolchain (ARM GCC, x86 GCC, etc.)
- Hardware platform or emulator

### Building K9

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HyperCogWizard/k9.git
   cd k9
   ```

2. **Build for specific architecture**:
   ```bash
   # For x86 PC
   cd pc && mk
   
   # For ARM OMAP (BeagleBoard)
   cd omap && mk
   
   # For ARM BCM (Raspberry Pi)
   cd bcm && mk
   
   # Build all architectures
   mk all
   ```

3. **Install bootloader**:
   ```bash
   mk pcboot  # For x86 systems
   mk install # Install to target location
   ```

### Configuration

K9 uses Plan 9-style configuration files:

**plan9.ini** (x86 example):
```ini
bootfile=k9.gz
console=0
*nomp=1
*maxmem=512
vgasize=1024x768x16
```

**Boot process**:
1. Bootloader loads kernel image
2. Architecture-specific initialization
3. Device enumeration and driver loading
4. Process spawning and system services
5. Cognitive pattern initialization

## üîß Development and Extension

### Adding New Architecture Support

1. Create new directory `arch/` with:
   - `main.c`: Architecture initialization
   - `dat.h`: Architecture-specific data structures
   - `fns.h`: Function prototypes
   - `mem.h`: Memory layout definitions
   - Device drivers in individual `.c` files

2. Update root `mkfile` to include new architecture

3. Implement required functions:
   - `archinit()`: Initialize architecture
   - `mpinit()`: Multi-processor support
   - `clockinit()`: Timer initialization

### Cognitive Engine Integration

K9's cognitive capabilities can be extended through:

1. **Pattern Recognition Modules**: Implement in `port/` for shared access
2. **Attention Mechanisms**: Extend scheduler with cognitive awareness
3. **Memory Synthesis**: Enhance caching with semantic understanding
4. **Hypergraph Processing**: Add graph computation primitives

Follow Plan 9 device driver conventions:
- Implement standard operations: attach, walk, stat, open, close, read, write
- Use proper locking mechanisms for concurrent access
- Handle power management and error conditions
- Support hot-plug/removal where applicable
